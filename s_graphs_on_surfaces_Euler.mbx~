    <title>Euler's Theorem</title>

<introduction> <p>This section cover's Euler's theorem on planar graphs and its applications.  We give a proof by of Euler's theorem by induction, and gave several applications of the theorem itself: more proofs that <m>K_{3,3}</m> and <m>K_5</m> aren't planar, that footballs have five pentagons, and a proof that our video game designers couldn't have made their map into a sphere without doing something very strange.</p>
