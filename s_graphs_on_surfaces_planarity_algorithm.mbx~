    <title>The planarity algorith</title>

<introduction> <p>In the previous chapter we showed that <em>K_{3,3}<\em> isn't planar; in this section we investigate how the ideas we used there -- namely, the Jordan Curve theorem and the fact that <m>K_{3,3}</m> is Hamiltonian -- generalize to other graphs.  In the end, this will culminate in "The Planarity Algorithm for Hamiltonian Graphs".</p>

<subection> <title>Stereographic Projection and Unnecessary cases</title>
<p>It will make our life easier if before we investigate other graphs we streamline our proof for <em>K_{3,3}</em> slightly: there were a few times where we had to treat different cases that wound up behaving essentially the same, and we'd like to see that we didn't actually need to treat them as separate cases.</p>
