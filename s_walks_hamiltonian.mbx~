<title>Hamiltonian cycles</title>
<intro><p>We now introduce the concept of Hamiltonian walks. Though on the surface the question seems very similar to determining whether or not a graph is Eulerian, it turns out to be much more difficult.</p>
</intro>

<definition><p>A graph is <em>Hamiltonian</em> if it has a closed walk that uses every vertex exactly once.</p></definition>

<p>First, some basic examples:</p>
<ol><li>The cycle graph <m>C_n</m> is Hamiltonian.</li>
<li>Any graph obtained from <m>C_n</m> by adding edges is Hamiltonian</li>
<li>The path graph <m>P_n</m> is <em>not</em> Hamiltonian.</li>
</ol>
