<introduction>
<p>This chapter covers several graph algorithms.  We start with two algorithms for finding minimal weight spanning trees, Kruskal's algorithm and Prim's algorithm.  We discuss Dijkstra's algorithm for finding the shortest path between two points in a directed, weighted graph.  
</p>
<p>Much of the material in this chapter is taken from the open source textbook Applied Combinatorics by Keller and Trotter.
