<title>Chromatic polynomial</title>
<introduction><p>For the chromatic number, we were asking whether or not it was possible to colour the vertices of <m>\bfG</m> with a given number of colours.  The chromatic polynomial enlarges this question, and asks the following.  Suppose we have <m>k</m> colours.  How many different ways can we colour the vertices of <m>\bfG</m>?</p></introduction>

<subsection><title>Definition and examples</title>
<definition><title>The chromatic polynomial <m>\chi_{\bfG}</m></title> <statement><p>The chromatic polynomial <m>\chi_{\bfG}</m> of a graph <m>\bfG</m> is the function that takes in a non-negative integer <m>k</m> and returns the number of ways to colour the vertices of <m>\bfG</m> with <m>k</m> colours so that adjacent vertices have different colours.</p></statement></definition>

<p>It is immediate from the definition of the chromatic polynomial that <m>\chi(\bfG)</m> is the least positive number <m>k</m> such that <m>\chi_{\bfG}(k)\neq 0</m>.</p>

<p>It is <m>not</m> immediate from the definition of the chromatic polynomial that it is, in fact, a polynomial.  In fact, proving that will take a little bit of work.  First, we look at some examples of the chromatic polynomial.</p>

<example><title>The empty graph <m>E_n</m></title><p>Recall that the empty graph <m>E_n</m> has <m>n</m> vertices and no edges.  To compute <m>\chi_{E_n}(k)</m> we need to count the number of ways to colour the vertices with <m>k</m> colours.  But since <m>E_n</m> has no edges, we can colour each of the <m>n</m> vertices any of the <m>k</m> colours; the choices are completely independent.  So <m>\chi_{E_n}(k)=k^n</m></p></example>

<example><title>The complete graph <m>K_n</m></title><p>Let's label the vertices <m>v_0,\dots, v_{n-1}</m>, and colour them one by one in the given order.  When we colour the first vertex <m>v_0</m>, no other vertices have been coloured, and we can use whichever of the <m>k</m> vertice we like.  However, when we go to colour <m>v_1</m> we note that it is adjacent to <m>v_0</m>, and so whatever colour we used for <m>v_0</m> we can't for <m>v_1</m>, and so we have <m>k-1</m> colours to choose for <m>v_1</m></p>

<p>Continuing in this way, we see that since all the vertices are adjacent, they all most have different colours.  So when we go to colour <m>v_i</m>, we have already coloured <m>v_o,\dots, v_{i-1}</m> with <m>i</m> different colours, and we can't use any of these to colour <m>v_i</m>, and so we have <m>k-i</m> choices to colour <m>v_i</m>. </p>

<p>Putting it all together, we see that: <me>\chi_{K_n}(k)=k\cdot (k-1)\cdot (k-2)\cdots k-n+1</me></p></example>

<p>What can we say about the chromatic polynomial of a graph <m>\bfG</m> that's the disjoint union of two smaller graphs: <m>\bfG=\bfG_1\sqcup \bfG_2</m>?</p>

<p>We already covered the extreme case where <m>\bfG=E_n</m> is just a disjoint union of vertices; we could colour each vertex independently of the others, as there were no edges between them at all. A similar argument works in general to give the following.</p>

<proposition><statement><p>Let <m>\bfG=\bfG_1\sqcup \bfG_2</m> be a disconnected graph.  Then <m>\chi_{\bfG}(k)=\chi_{\bfG_1}(k)\chi_{\bfG_2}(k)</m></p></statement><proof><p>Certainly, a colouring of <m>\bfG</m> with <m>k</m> colours gives a colouring of <m>\bfG_1</m> with <m>k</m> colours 


Similarly, to colour <m>\bfG</m> is exactly the same as giving a colouring of <m>\bfG_1</m></p></proof></proposition>
