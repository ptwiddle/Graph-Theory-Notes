<p>The first is that it can be complicated to keep track of edges that wrap around the sides of the torus.  If lots of them are wrapping around, it can be easy to lose track of which edges are connecting to which others on the opposite side.  One way to make this clearer is to label the crossing point on one side letters or numbers in order, and then on the opposite side label with the letters and numbers going in the same direction as indicated by the arrow.  Then you know that the edge that crosses at letter \(c\text{,}\) say, on one side, picks up at \(c\) on the other edge.</p>
