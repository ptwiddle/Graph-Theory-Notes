<p>Recall that Euler's handshaking lemma said that</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
\sum_{v\in G} d(v)=2 |E(G),
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>the sum of the degrees of all the vertices is twice the number of edges.  If we had some knowledge about the degrees of these vertices, we could get another relationship between the number of vertices and the number of edges.  For example, if \(G\) is regular of degree \(k\text{,}\) then every vertex has degree \(k\text{,}\) and hence the sum of all the degrees is just \(kn\text{.}\)  Hence, handshaking would tell us that \(kn=2m\text{,}\) and we would have another relationship between the three variables \(m,n\) and \(f\text{.}\)</p>
