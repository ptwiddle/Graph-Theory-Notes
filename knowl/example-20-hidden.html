<body><article class="example example-like"><p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">The graph \(\bfG_1\) in <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-K33-subs.html" title="Figure 4.3.1">FigureÂ 4.3.1</a> is \(K_{3,3}\) with a vertex and two edges added to it; put another way, \(K_{3,3}\) is a subgraph of \(\bfG_1\text{.}\)  If we could draw \(\bfG_1\) in the plane, we could just ignore this extra vertex and these two edges, and we'd have a drawing of \(K_{3,3}\) in the plane, but we know \(K_{3,3}\) isn't planar.  So to avoid contradictions we are forced to conclude that \(\bfG_1\) isn't planar.</p>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">The graph \(\bfG_2\) looks just like \(K_{3,3}\text{,}\) but we have added an extra vertex of degree two in the middle of one of the edges.  Note that \(K_{3,3}\) is <em class="emphasis">not</em> a subgraph of \(\bfG_2\text{,}\) and so we need to use slightly different reasoning than we did for showing \(\bfG\) isn't planar.  But drawing \(\bfG_2\) is just like drawing \(K_{3,3}\) and then adding an extra dot for the new vertex of degree two.  If we could draw \(\bfG_2\) in the plane, we could just skip adding this extra dot, and we'd have a drawing of \(K_{3,3}\) in the plane.  Again, since we know \(K_{3,3}\) isn't planar, we see that \(\bfG_2\) isn't planar, either.</p></article></body>
