<body><article class="example-like"><p>The wheel graph \(W_n\) consists of an \(n\)-cycle together with one additional vertex, that is connected to all vertices of the \(n\)-cycle.  Note that this with this convention, \(W_n\) confusingly has \(n-1\) vertices; other people may use a different convention where \(W_n\) has \(n\) vertices, but then it only has a \(n-1\) vertices on the actual wheel.</p>
<p>Since the central vertex is connected to all other vertices, once we colour it, we can never use that colour again.  But deleting that vertex we just have the \(n\)-cycle, and we already know the chromatic number of that.  So we have \(\chi(W_n)=\chi(C_n)+1\text{.}\)</p></article></body>
