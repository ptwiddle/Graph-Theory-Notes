<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">We will do this as follows: suppose that everyone at the party who knows each other shakes hands.  How many handshakes will occur?  On the one hand, from the definitions this would just be the number of edges in the graph.  On the other hand, we can count the number of handshakes working person-by-person: each person knows three other people, and so is involved in three handshakes.  But each handshake involves two people, and so if we count \(7*3\) we've counted each handhsake twice, and so there should be \(7*3/2=10.5\) handshakes happening, which makes no sense, as we can't have half a handshake.  Thus, we have a contradiction, and we conclude such a party isn't possible.</p>
