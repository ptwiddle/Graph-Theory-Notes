<p>Suppose that \(T_n\) is a tree on \(n\geq 2\) vertices.  Then \(T_n\) has an edge, and the two vertices on this edge must be different colours, and so \(\chi(T_n)\geq 2\text{.}\)  On the other hand, we can colour any tree with two colours as follows: pick any vertex, and colour it blue; then pick any vertex next to it and colour it red, then we can colour the vertices next to that blue, and colour the vertices next to those red, and continuing on outwards from our starting vertex.  Hence, \(\chi(T_n)\leq 2\) and so \(\chi(T_n)=2\text{.}\)</p>
<p>Another way of phrasing this is that along any path we colour the vertices alternating red-blue-red-blue-red-blue.  This wouldn't work for a general graph, because there may be two paths of different lengths between a pair of vertices \(v\) and \(w\text{.}\)  But in trees because there is always exactly one path between any two vertices, and so once we colour one vertex, there's a unique way to colour all the others with two colours in this way.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="s_chromatic_number.html#example-16">in-context</a></span>
