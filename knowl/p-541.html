<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Since \(\bfG\) and \(\bfG\setminus e\) have the same vertex, it is not too difficult to compare their colourings.  Any valid colouring of \(\bfG\) will give a colouring of \(\bfG\setminus e\text{,}\) but not every colouring of \(\bfG\setminus e\) arises this way -- in \(\bfG\text{,}\) colourings require that \(v\) and \(w\text{,}\) the two endpoints of \(e\text{,}\) have different colours, but there is no such requirement for \(\bfG\setminus e\text{.}\)  So, we want to count the colourings of \(\bfG\setminus e\) where \(v,w\) have the same colour.  But these are just the colourings of \(\bfG/e\text{:}\) given a colouring of \(\bfG/e\)m we can get a colouring of \(\bfG\) by giving most vertices the same colour, and giving both \(v,w\) whatever colour \(e\) was.  By definition, we see that \(v\) and \(w\) will have the same colour in this colouring; and given any colouring of \(\bfG\setminus e\) where \(v,w\) have the same colour we can get a colouring of \(\bfG/e\) by colouring \(e\) the colour that \(v,w\) were.</p>
