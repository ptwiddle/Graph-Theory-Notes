<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">1 implies 2: Supppose that \(\Gamma\) is connected, and let \(v, w\in V(\Gamma)\text{;}\) we want to show that there is a walk from \(v\) to \(w\text{.}\)</p>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Define \(S\subset V(\Gamma)\) to be the set of all vertices \(u\in V(\Gamma)\) so that there is a walk from \(v\) to \(u\text{;}\) we want to show that \(w\in S\text{.}\)</p>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">First, observe that there are no edges from \(S\) to \(V(\Gamma)\setminus S\text{.}\)  Suppose that \(e\) was an edge between \(a\in S\) and \(b\in\Gamma\setminus S\text{.}\)  Since \(a\in S\text{,}\) by the definition of \(S\) there is a walk \(v=v_0v_1v_2\cdots v_m=a\) from \(v\) to \(a\text{.}\)  We can add the edge \(e\) to the end of the walk, to get a walk from \(v\) to \(b\text{,}\) and hence by definition \(b\in S\text{.}\)</p>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Now suppose that \(w\notin S\text{.}\)  Then \(S\) and \(V(\Gamma)\setminus S\) are both nonempty, and by the above there are no edges between them, and so \(\Gamma\) is not connected, a contradiction.</p>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">To prove 2 implies 1, we prove the contrapositive.  If \(\Gamma\) is not connected, then there are two vertices \(v,w\in V(\Gamma)\) so that there is no walk from \(v\) to \(w\text{.}\)</p>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Suppose that \(\Gamma=\Gamma_1\sqcup\Gamma_2\text{,}\) and pick \(v\in V(\Gamma_1), w\in V(\Gamma_2)\text{.}\)  Any walk from \(v\) to \(w\) starts in \(V(\Gamma_1)\) and ends in \(V(\Gamma_2)\text{,}\) and so at some point there must be an edge from a vertex in \(\Gamma_1\) to a vertex in \(\Gamma_2\text{,}\) but there are no such edges \(\square\)</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="s_walks_basics.html#proof-7">in-context</a></span>
