<p>This will continue until they have arrived or left by every edge that hits \(v\text{.}\)  But every time they visit \(v\text{,}\) they must arrive by one edge, and leave by another one, and hence every visit uses up an even number of edges, and so the degree \(d(v)\) of \(v\) must be even.  But there was nothing special about the vertex \(v\text{,}\) and hence the degree of every vertex must be even.</p>
