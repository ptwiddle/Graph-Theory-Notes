<p>To extend our cycle to an Eulerian cycle, we delete all the edges used in the graph, and study the remaining graph.  In our case, this graph has two connected components, a four cycle and a three cycle.  Both of these are cycles themselves, they're trivially Eulerian, -- in general, it might take some work to find an Eulerian cycle for the components, but won't be too hard as the graph will be smaller.</p>
