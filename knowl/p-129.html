<p>To see the condition is sufficient we could also modify the argument for the Eulerian case slightly, but it is slicker instead to <em class="emphasis">reduce</em> to the Eulerian case.  Suppose that \(\Gamma\) is connected, and that vertices \(v\) and \(w\) have odd degree and all other vertices of \(\Gamma\) have even degree.  Then we can construct a new graph \(\Gamma^\prime\) by adding an extra edge \(e=vw\) to \(\Gamma\text{.}\)  Then \(\Gamma^\prime\) is connected and every vertex has even degree, and so it has an Eulerian cycle.  Deleting the edge \(e\) that we added from this cycle gives an Eulerian path from \(v\) to \(w\) in \(\Gamma\text{.}\)</p>
