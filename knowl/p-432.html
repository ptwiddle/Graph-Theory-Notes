<p>Consider the graph \(H\) consisting of two triangles joined along an edge. shown at the right.  We can calulate \(P_H(k)\) by working vertex by vertex: there are \(k\) ways to colour vertex 1, but then when we colour vertex 2 it can't be the same as vertex 1, and so there are \(k-1\) ways to colour it.  Vertex three is adjacent to both one and two, so there are \(k-2\) ways to colour it, and vertex 4 is adjacent to vertices 2 and 3, which have different colours as they are adjacent to each other, so there are \(k-2\) ways to colour it.  Putting it together, we see \(P_H(k)=k(k-1)(k-2)^2\)</p>
