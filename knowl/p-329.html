<p>A similar model, expanded slightly, is used in many other video games, like early ones in the Final Fantasy series, use essentially the same process to model the surface of a planet.  We claim theat any of these videogame words are actually the surface of a torus.  Instead of a computer screen, let's put the world on a very flexible flat sheet.  To get the left and right edges to match up, we can curl the screen up into a cylinder -- going off one edge takes us around the back of the cylinder.  Now, our cylinder has two circular boundaries, coming from the top and bottom of the screen, and to get these to match up we can bend our cylinder up and glue these together to make a torus.</p>
