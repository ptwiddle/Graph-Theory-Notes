<p>In our proof of Euler's theorem, the most complicated part was dealing with the situation if the edge \(e\) disconnects our graph \(\bfG\) when we remove it. In this case, instead of deleting the edge \(e\) we can contract it -- that is, shrink it to a point.  This would have result in a graph that is still planar and still connected, but with one less edge (\(e\) is no longer around), and one less vertex (the two vertices \(e\) connects are now merged into one).  The number of faces remains unchanged.  So the number of edges and the number of faces each decreased by one, these two changes cancel out when we calculate \(n-m+f\text{,}\) and hence both are equal to two.</p>
