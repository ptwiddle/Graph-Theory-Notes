<p>Finally, we can step up a dimension, we generally assume that the three dimensional space we live in is \(\reals^3\text{,}\) but what evidence do we have for that?  Maybe it's got some different shape, and if we could fly for untold light years in one direction we'd come back to the earth from a different direction!  I can recommend Janna Levin's popular science book / memoir "How the Universe got its Spots" for an account of how physicists studied whether patterns in the cosmic microwave background radiation could have been created by the universe being a shape other than \(\reals^3\text{.}\)</p>
