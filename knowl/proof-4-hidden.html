<body><article class="hiddenproof"><p>If \(\bfG\) has a cycle, the there are at least two paths between any vertex on that cycle -- the paths going each way around the cycle.  Thus, we just have to show that if there there are two paths between between \(v\) and \(w\text{,}\) then \(\bfG\) has a cycle.</p>
<p>In the easy case, the two paths will contain no vertices in common except for \(v\) and \(w\text{,}\) and so the union of the two paths will be a cycle.  In general, the paths will share other vertices and edges -- they may well repeat vertices and edges themselves.  But in any case, by considering some subset of these two paths will be a cycle.</p></article></body>
