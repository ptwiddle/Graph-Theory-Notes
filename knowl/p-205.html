<p>For the inductive step, suppose that \(\bfG\) is connected with \(m\text{,}\) and that every vertex has even degree, and that every graph \(\bfH\) with these properties and less than \(m\) edges is Eulerian.  Assume for now that we can find <em class="emphasis">a</em> closed walk in \(\bfG\) Suppose for now that we can find <em class="emphasis">a</em> closed walk \(w\) in \(\bfGM\) that doesn't repeat any edges -- we will justify this at the end of the proof.  If this closed walk uses all the edges of \(\bfG\) we are done.</p>
