<p>Since \(v_m\) is adjacent to \(e_m\) it has degree at least one; if it has degree 1 it is a leaf, and we've found a leaf.  If \(v_m\) is not a leaf, then there must be another edge coming out of it, say \(e_{m+1}\) going to \(v_{m+1}\text{.}\)  Note that \(v_{m+1}\) cannot be any of the vertices we've already found, as then we'd have more than one path between two vertices and hence a loop, but \(\bfT\) was a tree.  Thus we can make the path a bit longer.</p>
