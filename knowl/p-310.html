<p>Furthermore, going around the outside to "the left" or "to the right" are equivalent on the sphere -- you can slowly make the path around the sphere bigger and bigger, and then slip it around the north or south pole, and back.  Alternatively, we've already seen that the inside of the circle is equivalent to the outside of the circle on the sphere \(S^2\text{,}\) and on the inside of the circle it doesn't matter exactly how the two points are connected, and so it shouldn't matter on the outside, either.</p>
