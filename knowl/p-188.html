<p>Let \(\bfT=(V,S)\) be any spanning tree of minimum weight among all spanning trees that contain the forest \(\bfF\text{,}\) and suppose that \(e=xy\) is not an edge in \(\bfT\text{.}\) (If it were an edge in \(\bfT\text{,}\) we would be done.) Then let \(P=(x_0,x_1,x_2,\dots,x_t)\) be the unique path in \(\bfT\) with (a) \(x=x_0\text{;}\) (b) \(y=x_t\text{;}\) and (c) \(x_ix_{i+1}\in S\) for each \(i=0,1,2,\dots,t-1\text{.}\) Without loss of generality, we may assume that \(x=x_0\) is a vertex in \(C\) while \(y=x_t\) does not belong to \(C\text{.}\) Then there is a least non-negative integer \(i\) for which \(x_i\) is in \(C\) and \(x_{i+1}\) is not in \(C\text{.}\) It follows that \(x_j\) is in \(C\) for all \(j\) with \(0\le j\le i\text{.}\)</p>
