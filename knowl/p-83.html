<p>Suppose we had an arrangement of the cubes that was a solution. Then, from each cube, pick the edge representing the colors facing front and back on that cube. These four edges are a subgraph of our original graph, with one edge of each label, since we picked one edge from each cube. Furthermore, since we assumed the arrangement of cubes was a solution of instant insanity, each color appears once on the front face and once on the back. In terms of our subgraph, this translates into asking that each vertex has degree two.</p>
