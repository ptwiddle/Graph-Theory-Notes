<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Although we've only proven one direction of Kuratowski's theorem, it's the important direction -- the one that lets us prove graphs are nonplanar.  The other direction would tell us information about subgraphs of a graph that we already knew was nonplanar for some other reason.  Or, taking the contrapositive, it would let us prove a graph <em class="emphasis">was</em> planar by looking at all subgraphs of it and showing none of them looked like \(K_5\) or \(K_{3,3}\text{.}\)  But this would be a lot of work and there's a much easier way to show a graph is planar: draw it in the plane! If you're asked to prove a graph is planar, you will almost always also be asked to draw it in the plane.</p>
