<p>The most natural way to prove a graph isn't Hamiltonian is to do a case by case analysis of possible paths, showing it doesn't work.  For instance, in lecture we outlined the proof that if you remove a vertex from the Icosian graph, than the result isn't Hamiltonian.  A natural way to do this is to pick a vertex, and consider the possible pairs of edges the path might take through that vertex.  For each possibility, we know some edges won't be used, and can go further along that way.</p>
