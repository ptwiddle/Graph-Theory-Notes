<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">In the other direction, we assume that \(\bfG\) has no subgraphs isomorphic to \(C_{2k+1}\text{;}\) we need to prove that \(\bfG\) is bipartite.  Again, let's try to colour the vertices of \(\bfG\) red and blue so that adjancent vertices have different colours.  Choose a vertex \(v\) of \(\bfG\text{,}\) without loss of generality we may assume that \(v\) is coloured blue; then all vertices adjacent to \(v\) -- i.e., those vertices at distance 1 from \(v\) -- are coloured red.  The vertices adjacent to those must be blue, and the ones adjacent to those must be red, alternating out.  This suggests trying to colour all vertices at odd distance from \(v\) red, and those vertices at even distance from \(v\) blue.  We will show that if this colouring has two vertices of the same colour that are adjacent, then \(\bfG\) has an odd cycle.</p>
