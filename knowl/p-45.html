<p>If two graphs are not isomorphic, then you have to be able to prove that they aren't. Of course, one can do this by exhaustively describing the possibilities, but usually it's easier to do this by giving an obstruction â€“ something that is different between the two graphs. One easy example is that isomorphic graphs have to have the same number of edges and vertices. We'll discuss some others in the next section</p>
