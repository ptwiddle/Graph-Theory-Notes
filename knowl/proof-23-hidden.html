<body><article class="hiddenproof"><p>We need to show that we can colour any graph \(\bfG\) with \(\Delta(G)+1\) colours.  But we can just colour the vertices of \(\bfG\) one by one in whatever order we want.  When we go to colour the \(i\)th vertex \(v_i\text{,}\) we look at the \(d(v_i)\) vertices adjacent to \(v_i\text{.}\)  Some of them may not be coloured yet, in which case they don't affect anything, but for each vertex adjacent to \(v_i\) that is coloured, we can't use that colour for \(v_i\text{.}\)</p>
<p>So there are most \(d(v_i)\leq \Delta(\bfG)\) colours we have to avoid; if we have \(\Delta(\bfG)+1\) colours to choose from we can always find one that hasn't been used at a vertex adjacent to \(v_i\)</p>.</article></body>
