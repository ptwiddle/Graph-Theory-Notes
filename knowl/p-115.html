<p>Let us first prove that a tree on \(n\) vertices has \(n-1\) edges.  We will use induction on \(n\text{.}\)  As bases, there is only one tree with 1 vertex, and it does in fact have 0 edges, and there is only one tree with two vertices, and it does in fact have 1 edge.  So for the inductive step, let us suppose that we know that all trees with \(k\lt n\) vertices have \(k-1\) edges, and let \(\bfT\) be a tree with \(n\) vertices.  By Lemma, we know that \(\bfT\) has a leaf \(v\text{,}\) which by the definition of leaves is connected to the rest of \(\bfT\) by a single edge \(e\text{.}\)  If we delete \(v\) and \(e\) from \(\bfT\text{,}\) we get a smaller graph \(\bfT^\prime\) ince which has one less vertex and one less edge than \(\bfT\) did.</p>
