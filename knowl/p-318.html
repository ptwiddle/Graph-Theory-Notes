<p>The tricky part of using Kuratowski's theorem is actually <em class="emphasis">finding</em> the desired subgraph.  We won't really discuss algorithm aspects of this; for any graph you are asked to prove non-planar, it will be possible to do so by educated trial an error.  A few rules of thumb may be helpful, however.  First, note that subdivision cannot increase the degree of any vertex.  So, for \(\bfG\) to have a subgraph that's a subdivision of \(K_5, \bfG\) has to have at least 5 vertice with degree at least 4; if it doesn't, but we still suspect \(\bfG\) to be nonplanar, we know instead that we should be looking for a subdivision of \(K_{3,3}\text{.}\)</p>
