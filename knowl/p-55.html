<p>There is a puazzle marketed under the name "Instant Insanity", one version of which is shown above.  The puzzle is sometimes called "the four cubes problem", as it consists of four different cubes.   Each face of each cube is painted one of four different colours: blue, green, red or yellow. The goal of the puzzle is to line the four cubes up in a row, so that along the four long edges (front, top, back, bottom) each of the four colours appears eactly once.</p>
