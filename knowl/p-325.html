<p>It will make our life easier if before we investigate other graphs we streamline our proof for \(K_{3,3}\) slightly: there were a few times where we had to treat different cases that wound up behaving essentially the same, and we'd like to see that we didn't actually need to treat them as separate cases.  In particular, we would like to show that the following three seemingly different ways to connect the first two vertices lead to the same analysis: </p>
<ol class="decimal">
<li>Connecting them inside the Hamiltonian cycle</li>
<li>Connecting them outside "to the left"</li>
<li>Connecting them outside "to the right"</li>
</ol>
