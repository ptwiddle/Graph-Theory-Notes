<p>Another way of phrasing this is that along any path we colour the vertices alternating red-blue-red-blue-red-blue.  This wouldn't work for a general graph, because there may be two paths of different lengths between a pair of vertices \(v\) and \(w\text{.}\)  But in trees because there is always exactly one path between any two vertices, and so once we colour one vertex, there's a unique way to colour all the others with two colours in this way.</p>
