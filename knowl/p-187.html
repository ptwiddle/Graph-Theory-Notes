<p>Before discussing the proof of <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/thm_eulerian.html" title="Theorem 2.2.4">Theorem 2.2.4</a>, it's worth a little meta-discussion about proofs, intuition vs. rigor, and mathematics as a whole.  The proofing <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/thm_eulerian.html" title="Theorem 2.2.4">Theorem 2.2.4</a> is a common exam question, and you may not be used to studying for reproducing proofs on exams.  Certainly one way to prepare for such a question is to memorize the proof word for word.  There doesn't seem to be a lot of obvious value in this approach, however.  So why ask these questions on the exam? And this opens the door to more philosophical questions as well: how should we think/interact with proofs anyway?  What's the point of it all?</p>
