<p>In this section, we introduce another useful variant of a graph. In a graph, the existence of an edge \(xy\) can be used to model a connection between \(x\) and \(y\) that goes in both ways. However, sometimes such a model is insufficient. For instance, perhaps it is possible to fly from Atlanta directly to Fargo but not possible to fly from Fargo directly to Atlanta. In a graph representing the airline network, an edge between Atlanta and Fargo would lose the information that the flights only operate in one direction. To deal with this problem, we introduce a new discrete structure. A <dfn class="terminology">digraph</dfn> \(\bfG\) is a pair \((V,E)\) where \(V\) is a vertex set and \(E\subset V\times V\) with \(x\neq y\) for every \((x,y)\in E\text{.}\) We consider the pair \((x,y)\) as a <dfn class="terminology">directed edge</dfn> from \(x\) to \(y\text{.}\) Note that for distinct vertices \(x\) and \(y\) from \(V\text{,}\) the ordered pairs \((x,y)\) and \((y,x)\) are distinct, so the digraph may have one, both or neither of the directed edges \((x,y)\) and \((y,x)\text{.}\) This is in contrast to graphs, where edges are sets, so \(\{x,y\}\) and \(\{y,x\}\) are the same.</p>
