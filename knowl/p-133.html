<p>You might worry that the argument above suggests we can carry on the walk forever, which we obviously can't do since the graph is finite, but the argument above doesn't work for \(v_0\text{:}\) when we start the path out at \(v_0\text{,}\) we haven't had to arrive there, and so the edge we initially leave by is not paired with anything.  Therefore, if \(\Gamma\) has all vertices with even degree, and we walk randomly for as long as we can, we'll always get stuck at our starting vertex.</p>
