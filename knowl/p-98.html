<p>Informally, the condition that \(\bfG\) is connected is asking that \(\bfG\) have enough edges, while the condition that \(\bfG\) has no cycles is asking for \(\bfG\) not to have too many edges.  Thus, trees are sort of "goldilocks" graphs -- they have enough edges, but not too many -- they're connected, but just barely.</p>
