<p>Notice that in our discussion of Dijkstra's algorithm, we required that the edge weights be nonnegative. If the edge weights are lengths and meant to model distance, this makes perfect sense. However, in some cases, it might be reasonable to allow negative edge weights. For example, suppose that a positive weight means there is a cost to travel along the directed edge while a negative edge weight means that you make money for traveling along the directed edge. In this case, a directed path with positive total weight results in paying out to travel it, while one with negative total weight results in a profit. </p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><p>Give an example to show that Dijkstra's algorithm does not always find the path of minimum total weight when negative edge weights are allowed.</p></li>
<li><p>Bob and Xing are considering this situation, and Bob suggests that a little modification to the algorithm should solve the problem. He says that if there are negative weights, they just have to find the smallest (i.e., most negative weight) and add the absolute value of that weight to every directed edge. For example, if \(w(x,y)\geq -10\) for every directed edge \((x,y)\text{,}\) Bob is suggesting that they add \(10\) to every edge weight. Xing is skeptical, and for good reason. Give an example to show why Bob's modification won't work.</p></li>
