Since the Petersen graph is regular of degree three, we know that it can't have a subgrpah that's a subdivision of \(K_5\text{,}\) as it would need to have some vertices of degree 4 or larger.</p>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">It makes sense to attempt a greedy algorithm -- in the standard drawing of the Petersen grpah, pick the very top vertex 1 to be "red" and the three vertices adjacent to it to, 2, 5, and 6, to be "blue".  We need two more red vertices.  All vertices left are adjacent to exactly one blue vertex, so from a greedy point of view there is no preference for which vertex we pick to be the next blue vertex.  Let us pick 9 to be another red vertex.  Then it is connected directly to blue vertex 6, but we must find paths from 9 to 2 and 5.  We could, for instance, take the path 9-4-3-2 to connect to 2, but that would use two vertices up while the path 9-7-2 only uses one extra vertex, and so seems better.  Then we can connected 9 to 5 through vertex 4, and vertex 9 has been connected to all the blue vertices.</p>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Now, we need to choose one more vertex to be a red vertex, and the vertices we haven't used are 3, 10, and 8.  If we tried to make 3 the last red vertex we run into a problem: we need to connect vertex 3 to 3 other vertices, but one of the edges goes to vertex 4 which was one of the subdivided vertices that we can't visit again.  Hence, we only have two possible paths out of 3, and will ever only be able to connect it to two blue vertices.  A similar problem occurs if we try to make 10 the last red vertex -- it's adjacent to the vertex 7 used as a subdivided vertex.  The remaining choice is vertex 8, which works, as shown in the following diagram.</p>
