<p>Let's label the vertices \(v_0,\dots, v_{n-1}\text{,}\) and colour them one by one in the given order.  When we colour the first vertex \(v_0\text{,}\) no other vertices have been coloured, and we can use whichever of the \(k\) vertice we like.  However, when we go to colour \(v_1\) we note that it is adjacent to \(v_0\text{,}\) and so whatever colour we used for \(v_0\) we can't for \(v_1\text{,}\) and so we have \(k-1\) colours to choose for \(v_1\)</p>
<p>Continuing in this way, we see that since all the vertices are adjacent, they all most have different colours.  So when we go to colour \(v_i\text{,}\) we have already coloured \(v_o,\dots, v_{i-1}\) with \(i\) different colours, and we can't use any of these to colour \(v_i\text{,}\) and so we have \(k-i\) choices to colour \(v_i\text{.}\)</p>
<p>Putting it all together, we see that:</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
\chi_{K_n}(k)=k\cdot (k-1)\cdot (k-2)\cdots k-n+1
\end{equation*}
