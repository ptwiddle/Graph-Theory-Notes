Vertex 1 can be any of \(k\) colours, and vertex 2 has \(k-1\) possibilities -- any colour except the one used for vertex 1.  Moving to vertex 4, we see it is just adjacent to 1 as well, and so has \(k-1\) possibilities as well.</p></div>

<p>It becomes more difficult when we try to colour vertex 3.  It is adjacent to vertices 2 and 4, and so cannot be the same colour as either of these.  However, vertices 2 and 4 are not adjacent, and so we don't know whether they have the same colour or not.  If vertices 2 and 4, have the same colour there are \(k-1\) possibilities for vertex 3, while if vertices 2 and 4 have different colours, there are only \(k-2\) possibilties.  Thus, we must count how many possibilities are in each of these cases.</p>
<p>If we want vertices 2 and 4 to have the same colour, we can first colour vertex 1 in \(k\) different ways, and then pick any of the remaining \(k-1\) colours for vertices 2 and 4.  Then, to complete this to a colouring of \(C_4\text{,}\) we have to colour \(v_3\text{,}\) which can be any of the \(k-1\) colours that aren't the colour \(v_2\) and \(v_4\) are coloured.  Thus, the case where \(v_2\) and \(v_4\) have the same colour has \(k(k-1)^2\) possibilities.</p>
<p>If we want vertices 2 and 4 to have different colours, then we can first colour \(v_1\) any of \(k\) colours, colour \(v_2\) any of \(k-1\) colours.  Now, when we go to colour vertex 4 it can't be the same colour as vertex 1 since they are adjacent, and it can't be the same colour as vertex 2 by our supposition.  Vertices \(v_1\) and \(v_2\) have different colours, and so this leaves \(k-2\) possibilities for \(v_4\text{.}\)  Thus there are \(k(k-1)(k-2)\) possibilities to colour vertices 1, 2 and 4 so that 2 and 4 have different colours, and then there are \(k-2\) possibilities left for vertex 3, giving \(k(k-1)(k-2)^2\) ways to colour \(C_4\) so that vertices 2 and 4 have different colours.</p>
<p>Adding the two cases together, this gives:</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{align*}
P_{C_4}(k)\amp=k(k-1)^2+k(k-1)(k-2)^2\\
\amp=k(k-1)[k-1+(k-2)^2]\\
\amp=k(k-1)(k^2-3k+3)
\end{align*}
