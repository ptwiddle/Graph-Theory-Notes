<p>Before seeing it in practice, let's discuss informally how the Jordan Curve Theorem can be used to help prove whether a graph \(G\) is planar or not.  Suppose that we have found a large cycle \(C_k\) as a subgraph of \(G\text{.}\)  Then, if we had a planar drawing of \(G\text{,}\) this cycle would have to appear as a circle.  By the Jordan Curve Theorem, this circle would have an inside and an outside, and every vertex and edge not in our cycle \(C_k\) would have to be either entirely within the circle, or entirely outside the circle.  This gives us a way to organize the case by case argument.</p>
