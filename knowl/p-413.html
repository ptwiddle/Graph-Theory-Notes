<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">We will do this by copying the videogame worlds we saw in the introduction.  Draw a square to represent the videogame screen, and then draw the graph inside the square, with the added proviso that if while drawing an edge of the graph we hit the border of the square, we continue the edge at the same point of the opposite side of the square.  To make clear what we're doing, it is useful to draw arrows on the edges of the square to indicate how they are being identified -- we put one arrowhead, pointing the same direction, on the left and right edges, to indicate that they are being identified, with the tip end end of one edge being marked to the tip end of the other, and the tail end being matched to the tail end of the other.  We draw two arrowheads on the top and bottom edges, also pointing the same direction.</p>
