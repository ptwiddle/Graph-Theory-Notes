<p>By itself, Euler's theorem doesn't seem that useful: there are three variables (the numbers of edges, vertices, and faces) and only one equation between them, so there are still lots of degrees of freedom.  For it to be particularly useful, we want to have other relationships between these numbers.  In many applications, these relationships can come from handshaking.</p>
