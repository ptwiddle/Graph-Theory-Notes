<p>Usually in books or in lectures, proofs are only given in slick, elegant, polished formal versions.  There are many reasons for this: there's a certain beauty to it; it's important to write it out formally to make sure it's all correct; there's only so much time in lectures, and brevity is a virtue anyway.  People turn away from long works, and the main point of a proof, after all, is to prove something, and it's easier to check that it's all correct if it's shorter.</p>
