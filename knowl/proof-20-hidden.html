<body><article class="hiddenproof"><p>We give a proof by contradiction.  Suppose \(K_5\) was planar, and draw it on the plane.  We know that \(K_5\) has 5 vertices and \(\binom{5}{2}=10\) edges, and so by Euler theorem we know that any drawing of it must have 7 faces. We now use edge-face handshaking to get a contradiction.</p>
<p>What could the degrees of the faces be?  We don't know for sure, but we know that none of the faces could have degree one or two, as then the edges would form a loop or multiple edges between two vertices, but \(K_5\) is simple.  Hence, every face must have \(d(f)\geq 3\text{.}\)  But then handshaking gives:</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
20=2e=\sum d(f)\geq \sum 3=3\cdot 7=21
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>which is the desired contradiction, and so we conclude that \(K_5\) is not, in fact, planar.</p></article></body>
