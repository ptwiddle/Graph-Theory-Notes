<p>The cycle graph on 5 vertices, \(C_5\) is isomorphic to its complement, \(C_5^c\text{.}\)  The cycle \(C_5\) is usually drawn as a pentagon, and if we were then going to naively draw \(C_5^c\) we would draw a 5-sided star.  However, we could draw \(C_5^c\) differently as shown, making it clear that it is isomorphic to \(C_5\text{,}\) with isomorphism \(\varphi:C_5\to C_5^c\) defined by \(\varphi(a)=a, \varphi(b)=c, \varphi(c)=e, \varphi(d)=b, \varphi(e)=d\text{.}\)</p>
