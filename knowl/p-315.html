<p>Conceptually, it can be useful to think that some vertices of \(\bfG\) are going to be vertices of your \(K_5\) or \(K_{3,3}\text{,}\) and we're going to need to connect those.  We can use the remaining vertices of \(\bfG\) as parts of subdivided edges between these, but these extra vertices can only be used in at most one such connection.  Thus, these extra vertices are a limited resource we have, and a useful heuristic in looking for subgraph is to take a "greedy" approach, where we choose our vertices to require as few subdivisions as possible to make connections.  We illustrate this idea in the next example.</p>
