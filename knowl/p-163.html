<p>But if we look at the edges we haven't used, they will form a simpler graph. \(\Gamma^\prime\text{.}\)  There's no reason for \(\Gamma^\prime\) to be connected, but it's not too hard to see that every vertex of \(\Gamma^\prime\) will still have even degree: in \(\Gamma\) every vertex had even degree, and we saw in our first proof that a closed walk that doesn't repeat edges uses up an even number of edges at each vertex, and so we'll have an even number of edges left at each point.  Thus, each connected piece of \(\Gamma^\prime\) satisfies the hypothesis of the problem, and is simpler, so we can try to find a closed walk on each of connected piece of \(\Gamma^\prime\text{,}\) and then "stitch" the results together to get a walk that uses all the pieces. In the formal proof, this process is best captured using induction, and we'll save the complete description until then, but for now we illustrate the process in an example</p>
