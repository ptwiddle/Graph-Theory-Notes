<p>Another idea is to try to minimze the number of such crossings, and draw as much of the graph as possible in the center of the square, and only a few edges wrapping around the torus.  One heuristic to follow is to work like we did with the planarity algorithm for Hamiltonian graphs, and try to draw a large cycle as a cycle in the square.  Then, connect as many edges and extra vertices as possible through the centre of the cycle, and only when you've ruled that out try to wrap edges around the torus.  This is the approach taken in the drawing of \(K_5\) in <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig_k5_and_k6_on_torus.html" title="Figure 3.4.2">FigureÂ 3.4.2</a>; the outside house is a Hamiltonian cycle, two edges could be drawn in the center of the house, and then the remaining three edges have no choice to be drawn wrapping around the torus.</p>
