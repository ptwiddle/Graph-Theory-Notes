<p>A group of friends enjoyed strolling through the city, and created a game: could they take a walk in the city, crossing every bridge exactly once, and return to where they started from? They couldn't find such a walk, but they couldn't prove such a walk wasn't possible, and so they wrote to the mathematician Euler, who proved that such a walk is not possible.</p>
