<p>So we've argued that if we're trying to draw a graph on the sphere, all three cases are the same, but it should still feel like a bait-and-switch: we weren't trying to draw graphs on there sphere, we were trying to draw graphs on the plane.  The connection comes from the fact that the sphere can be viewed as a plane with one additional point.</p>
