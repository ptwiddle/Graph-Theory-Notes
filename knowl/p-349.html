<p>This section cover's Euler's theorem on planar graphs and its applications.  We give a proof by of Euler's theorem by induction, and gave several applications of the theorem itself: more proofs that \(K_{3,3}\) and \(K_5\) aren't planar, that footballs have five pentagons, and a proof that our video game designers couldn't have made their map into a sphere without doing something very strange.</p>
