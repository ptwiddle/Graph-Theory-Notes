<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Imagine you work for a company, travelling from city to city, trying to sell some product in each (for instance, encyclopedias).  You are assigned a list of cities you need to visit, and you need to start from your home, travel from city to city visiting them all, and finally return to your home.  Of course, travelling from city to city is expensive (either in terms of money, travel time, or something else), and to turn a profit your company wants you to organize the order you visit each of cities so that the total cost is as cheap as possible.  This minimiziation problem is the TSP.</p>
