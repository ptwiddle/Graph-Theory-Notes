<p>Although solving the graph isomorphism problem for general graphs is quite difficult, doing it for small graphs by hand is not too bad and is something you must be able to do for the exam.  If the two graphs are actually isomorphic, then you should show this by exhibiting an isomrophism; that is, writing down an explicit bijection between their vertex sets with the desired properties. The most attractive way of doing this, for humans, is to label the vertices of both copies with the same letter set.</p>
