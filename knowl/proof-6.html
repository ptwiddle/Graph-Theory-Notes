<p>Since being connected is half of the requirement of being a tree, we need to show that a connected graph on \(n\) vertices is a tree if and only if it has \(n-1\) edges.</p>
<p>Let us first prove that a tree on \(n\) vertices has \(n-1\) edges.  We will use induction on \(n\text{.}\)  As bases, there is only one tree with 1 vertex, and it does in fact have 0 edges, and there is only one tree with two vertices, and it does in fact have 1 edge.  So for the inductive step, let us suppose that we know that all trees with \(k\lt n\) vertices have \(k-1\) edges, and let \(\bfT\) be a tree with \(n\) vertices.  By Lemma, we know that \(\bfT\) has a leaf \(v\text{,}\) which by the definition of leaves is connected to the rest of \(\bfT\) by a single edge \(e\text{.}\)  If we delete \(v\) and \(e\) from \(\bfT\text{,}\) we get a smaller graph \(\bfT^\prime\) ince which has one less vertex and one less edge than \(\bfT\) did.</p>
<p>Since \(\bfT\) was a tree, it follows that \(\bfT^\prime\) is a tree, too -- check this yourself, using the definition of a tree!  Then, since \(\bfT^\prime\) is a tree with \(n-1\) vertices, byt the inductive hypothesis it follows that it has one less edge \(n-2\) edges, and so \(\bfT\) must have \(n-1\) edges, which is what we were trying to show.</p>
<p>Now we show the other direction: that if \(\bfG\) is a simple connected graph with \(n\) vertices and \(n-1\) edges,  then \(\bfG\) is a tree.  The basic structure of the proof is the same as the other direction: find a vertex \(v\) adjacent to a single edge \(e\text{,}\) and delete \(v\) and \(e\) to get a smaller tree, where we can assume the proposition holds, and then use induction.</p>
<p>To play the role of the lemma that every tree has a leaf, we will establish the following statement:  if \(\bfG\) is a connected graph with \(n\) vertices and \(n-1\) edges, then /p&gt;\(\bfG\) has a vertex of degree 1.  Note that since \(\bfG\) is connected, it can't have any vertices of degree 0, and so to prove it has a vertex of degree 1 it is enough to show that it has a vertex of degree strictly less than 2.  Thus, for contradiction assume that every vertex \(v\) of \(\bfG\) has degree \(d(v)\geq 2\text{.}\)  But then the handshaking lemma would say:</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
2(n-1)=2e=\sum d(v)\geq \sum 2=2n
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p data-braille="continuation">a contradiction, and hence \(\bfG\) must have a vertex of degree 1, as desired.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="s_intro_trees.html#proof-6">in-context</a></span>
