<p>The definition of walk above contains some extra information.  If we just know the sequence of edges we can reconstruct what the vertices have to be (assuming we have at least two edges in the walk).  Alternatively, if the graph \(\Gamma\) does not have multiple edges, it is enough to just know the vertices \(v_i\text{,}\) but if \(\Gamma\) has multiple edges that just knowing the vertices does not determine the walk.</p>
