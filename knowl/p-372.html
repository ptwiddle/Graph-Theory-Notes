<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Another method inolves a qualitive change of view.  The greedy algorithms we describe so far are only heuristics to getting a decent path.  There is no guarantee that they produce an output that is in any way close to the optimal path, and indeed examples can be engineered to make them extremely bad.  It would be nice to have an upper bound that was guaranteed to not be <em class="emphasis">too</em> far off the optimal solution.  The Christofides algorithm does just that, by producing a Hamiltonian cycle that is guaranteed to have weight at most 3/2 of the weight of the optimal solution.  Very briefly, it does this by starting with a minimal weight spanning tree, makes a subgraph by adding edges to the tree until every vertex has even degree, taking an Eulerian circuit of that, and then removing edges to get a Hamiltonian cycle.</p>
