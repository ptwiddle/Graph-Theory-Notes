<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">We can model the situation a graph, with vertices being people at the party, and an edge between two vertices if the corresponding people know each other.  The question is then asking for the existence of a graph with seven vertices so that every vertex has degree three.  It is then natural to attempt to solve the problem by trying to draw such a graph.  After a few foiled attempts, we begin to suspect that it's not possible, but doing a case-by-case elimination of all the possibilities is daunting.  It's easier to find a reason why we can't draw such a graph.</p>
