<p>Let's analyse where else the edge adjacent to \(v_1\) could go.  It can't go to \(v_1\) itself, as the Petersen graph has no loops, and it can't go to \(v_2\) or \(v_{10}\) as the Petersen graph has no multiple edges.  If it went to \(v_3\) or \(v_9\) it would make a three cycle, which the Petersen graph doesn't have, and if it went to \(v_4\) or \(v_7\text{,}\) there'd be a four cycle.  Hence, the only options are \(v_1\) is adjacent to \(v_5, v_6\) or \(v_7\text{.}\)  By reversing the direction of the Hamiltonian path, \(v_5\) and \(v_7\) are equivalent, and there are only two cases.</p>
