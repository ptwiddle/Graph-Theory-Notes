<p>Consider the standard Instant Insanity puzzle, with four cubes and four colours.  Explain why one would expect there to be 331,776 different cube configurations.  Further explain why there would be fewer configurations if any cubes are coloured with symmetries.</p>
<p>In the text, we solve the puzzle by finding certain pairs of subgraphs.  Assuming that none of the cubes are coloured symmetrically, explain why each pair of subgraphs corresponds to at least 8 different cube configurations that are actually solutions, and why, depending on the isomorphism type of the subgraphs found, there may be more solutions.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="s_intro_exercises.html#exercise-8">in-context</a></span>
