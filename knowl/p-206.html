<p>If \(w\) doesn't use all the edges of \(\bfG\text{,}\) we can delete all the edges used in \(w\) and get a graph \(\bfG\setminus w\) with less edges.  Though \(\bfG\setminus w\) will probably not be connected, every vertex in \(\bfG\setminus w\) will have even degree, as we've subtracted an even number of edges from each vertex that \(w\) visits as argued in the first part of the proof.  Thus, by the inductive hypothesis each connected component \(\bfG\setminus w\) will have an Eulerian cycle.  Since the \(\bfG\) is connected, \(w\) must include at least one point from each component of \(\bfG\setminus w\text{,}\) and so we can insert the Eulerian walk from each component into \(w\) when we reach that component, to obtain a closed walk that uses all the vertices of \(\bfG\) as desired.</p>
