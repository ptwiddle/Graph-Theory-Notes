<p>As an early application of graph theory, Cayley used these ideas to count the number of isomers of Alkanes (with some mistakes).  In general, you can count isomers of any molecule by counting isomorphism classes of graphs with given degree sequences, but it can help organize the search to know, e.g., that they're all trees.  To make sure we don't miss or double count any, it's useful to organize the enumeration according to some principle; for Alkanes one way is to organize according to the longest path of carbons, another is to restrict degree sequences to just how the carbons have connected to other carbons.</p>
