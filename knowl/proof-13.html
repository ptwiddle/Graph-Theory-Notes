<p>We will argue by contradiction, and begin by passing to a maximal counterexample.  Note that if \(\bfG\) satisfies the hypotheses, and we add an edge \(e\) to \(\bfG\) between two non-adjacent vertices \(v\) and \(w\text{,}\) then the result will still satisfy the hypothesis.  Indeed, we've only increased the degree of some vertices.  So, we had a counterexample \(\bfG\) to Ore's Theorem, we could iteratively add edges to \(\bfG\) that didn't create Hamiltonian cycles, until we got a graph \(\bfG\) that satisfies the hypotheses of Ore's theorem, desn't have any Hamiltonian cycles, but if we add any edge \(e\) to \(\bfG\) the result <em class="emphasis">is</em> Hamiltonian.</p>
<p>We now observe that such a \(\bfG\) must have a Hamiltonian <em class="emphasis">path</em>: indeed, pick any edge \(e\) not in \(\bfG\) and add it to \(\bfG\text{.}\)  THe resulting graph is by assumption Hamiltonian, and since \(\bfG\) wasn't Hamiltonian, the Hamiltonian cycle must contain the edge \(e\text{.}\)  Deleting the edge \(e\) from the Hamiltonian cycle gives a Hamiltonian path in \(\bfG\text{.}\)</p>
<p>Thus, let \(v_1-v_2-\cdots v_n\) be a Hamiltonian path in \(\bfG\text{.}\)  We know \(v_1\) and \(v_n\) are not adjacent, as otherwise \(\bfG\) would be Hamiltonian.  Thus, since \(\bfG\) satisfies the hypothesis of Ore's theorem,  we know \(d(v_1)+d(v_n)\geq n\text{.}\)  We already have one edge adjacent to \(v_1\text{,}\) and one edge adjacent to \(v_n\text{,}\) and so there must be at least \(n-2\) other edges adjacent to one or other of these vertices.  We will see that no matter how we add \(n-2\) edges to these two vertices, we will create a Hamiltonian cycle.</p>
<p>To see this, note there is ever an \(i\) with \(v_1\) adjacent to \(v_i\) and \(v_{i-1}\) adjacent to \(v_n\text{,}\) then \(\bfG\) would have a Hamiltonian cycle: namely \(v_1-v_2-\cdots-v_{i-1}-v_n-v_{n-1}-\vdots v_i-v_1\text{.}\)  Now, there are \(n-3\) different vertices we can add edges to \(v_1\) to, namely \(v_3-v_{n-1}\text{,}\) and similarly there are \(n-3\) vertices we can add edges connecting \(v_n\) to, namely \(v_2, \dots v_{n-2}\text{.}\)  We arrange these \(2(n-3)\) edges into a a grid with 2 rows and \(n-3\) columns, so that the two edges in each column are \(v_1-v_i\) and \(v_n-v_{i-1}\text{,}\) a pair of edges that can form a Hamiltonian cycle as in the last paragraph.</p>
<p>As we need to add at least \(n-2\) edges, but we only have \(n-3\) columns, there must be at least one column that contains two edges by the pigeonhole principle, but then we can create a Hamiltonian cycle using those two edges and the edges in our Hamiltonian path.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="s_walks_hamiltonian.html#proof-13">in-context</a></span>
