<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Any molecule with formula \(C_nH_{2n+2}\) is an <em class="emphasis">alkane</em>.  Although in general alkanes can have multiple isomers, every isomer of an Alkane will always be a tree, as we now show.</p>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">To show a graph is a tree, it suffices to show that it is connected and that the number of edges is one less than the number of vertices.  Since Alkanes are molecules, we know that the graph is connected.  Furthermore, \(C_nH_{2n+2}\) has \(n\) carbons adn \(2n+2\) hydrogens, and hence has \(3n+2\) vertices.  Thus, it is enough to show that any molecule with formula \(C_nH_{2n+2}\) has \(3n+1\) edges.</p>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">To do this, we use the handshaking lemma: \(2e=\sum d(v)\text{.}\)  Each of the \(n\) carbons has degree 4, so the carbons contribute \(4n\) to the total degree, and each hydrogen of the \(2n+2\) has degree 1 and so only contributes 1 to the sum of degrees.  Hence, twice the number of edges is equal to \(4n+(2n+2)=6n+2\text{,}\) and so there are \(3n+1\) edges, as desired.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="s_intro_trees.html#example-11">in-context</a></span>
