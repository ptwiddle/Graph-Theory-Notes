<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">The main thing you'll need to be able to do with Hamiltonian graphs is decide whether a given graph is Hamiltonian or not.  Although the definition of Hamiltonian graph is very similar to that of Eulerian graph, it turns out the two concepts behave very differently.  While Euler's Theorem gave us a very easy criterion to check to see whether or not a graph Eulerian, there is no such criterion to see if a graph is Hamiltonian or not.  It turns out that deciding whether or not a graph is Hamiltonian is NP-complete, meaning that if we could solve that problem efficiently, then you could solve a host of other difficult problems efficiently as well.</p>
