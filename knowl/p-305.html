<p>Suppose that \(G\) is Hamiltonian, and choose a Hamiltonian cycle; if \(G\) were planar than this cycle must be drawn as a circle, and every other edge must either lie entirely inside or entirely outside the graph.  Now consider two edges \(e=ab\) and \(f=xy\) that are not part of the cycle.  Depending on the order that \(a,b,x\) and \(y\) appear as you go around the Hamiltonian cycle, one of two things will happen: </p>
<ol class="decimal">
<li>If the vertices of \(e\) and \(f\) do not interlace (e.g. \(abxy, yxab, xbay,\cdots\)), or if they share a vertex (e.g., \(a=x\)), then \(e\) may be drawn both inside or both outside the circle without crossing</li>
<li>If the vertices of \(e\) and \(f\) do interlace (e.g. \(axby, xayb, yaxb,\dots...\)) then if \(e\) and \(f\) are drawn both inside or both outside the circle, they must cross</li>
</ol>
