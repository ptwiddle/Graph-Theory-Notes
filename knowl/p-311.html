<p>Let's apply the planarity algorithm to the complete graph \(K_5\text{.}\)  Let's label the vertices 1-5, and take our Hamiltonian cycle \(C\) to be 123451, which we've drawn as the outside pentagon in the following figure: <figure class="figure-like"><img src="images/image-42.svg" width="70%" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;" alt=""><figcaption><span class="type">Figure</span><span class="codenumber">4.2.6</span>The graph (\(K_5\))</figcaption></figure> Since \(K_5\) has \(\binom{5}{2}=10\) vertices, there are 5 edges that aren't used in \(C\text{,}\) namely 13,14, 24,25, and 35.  So Cross(\(K_5, 123451\)) will consist of these five vertices.  We see that 13 will be adjacent to 24 and 25, since these edges would cross if drawn inside, but 13 is not adjacent to 14 or 35, since these edges would cross 13 if drawn on the same side of the circle, as illustrated in the next figure</p>
