<p>Finally, we explain some heuristics about drawing graphs on surfaces, with reference drawings of \(K_{3,3}\) on the Möbius strip.  As discussed at the end of the section of the torus, it can be useful to follow part of the reasoning used in the planarity algorithm for Hamiltonian cycles when trying to draw graphs on surfaces other than the sphere.  That is, start with a large cycle in the graph -- for \(K_{3,3}\text{,}\) with $a,b,c$ red vertices, and $x,y,z$ the blue vertices, we will use the cycle $axbycza$.  It may be that this is cycle is drawn in the plane as a circle, as the in the left hand example; then we try to connect as many edges as possible through the centre of the circle, and then do the rest on the outside, possible wrapping around the Möbius strip.</p>
