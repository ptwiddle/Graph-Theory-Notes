<body><article class="hiddenproof"><p>Let's try to colour the vertices of \(C_n\) red and blue so that adjacent vertices have different colour.  Without loss of generality, we may assume that \(v_1\) is coloured blue.  Then since it is adjacent to \(v_1, v_2\) must be coloured red.  Continuing in this way, we see that \(v_k\) is blue for odd \(k\) and red for even \(k\text{.}\)  But \(v_n\) is adjacent to \(v_1\text{,}\) and so these will have different colours precisely when \(n\) is even.</p></article></body>
