<div class="sbspanel" style="width:80%;justify-content:flex-start;"><p>Let's see what Kruskal's algorithm does on the weighted graph in <a knowl="./knowl/fig_graphalgorithms_spantreegraph.html" knowl-id="xref-fig_graphalgorithms_spantreegraph" alt="Figure 3.1.1 " title="Figure 3.1.1 ">FigureÂ 3.1.1</a>.  It first sorts all of the edges by weight. We won't reproduce the list here, since we won't need all of it. The edge of least weight is \(ck\text{,}\) which has weight \(23\text{.}\) It continues adding the edge of least weight, adding \(ag\text{,}\) \(fg\text{,}\) \(fi\text{,}\) \(fj\text{,}\) and \(bj\text{.}\) However, after doing this, the edge of lowest weight is \(fb\text{,}\) which has weight \(38\text{.}\) This edge cannot be added, as doing so would make \(fjb\) a cycle. Thus, the algorithm bypasses it and adds \(bc\text{.}\) Edge \(ai\) is next inspected, but it, too, would create a cycle and is eliminated from consideration. Then \(em\) is added, followed by \(dl\text{.}\) There are now <em class="emphasis">two</em> edges of weight \(56\) to be considered: \(al\) and \(dj\text{.}\) Our sorting algorithm has somehow decided one of them should appear first, so let's say it's \(dj\text{.}\) After adding \(dj\text{,}\) we cannot add \(al\text{,}\) as \(agfjdl\) would form a cycle. Edge \(dk\) is next considered, but it would also form a cycle. However, \(ek\) can be added. Edges \(km\) and \(dm\) are then bypassed. Finally, edge \(ch\) is added as the twelfth and final edge for this \(13\)-vertex spanning tree. The full list of edges added (in order) is shown to the right. The total weight of this spanning tree is \(504\text{.}\)</p></div>
