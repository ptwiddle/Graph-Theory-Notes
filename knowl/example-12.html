<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">We illustrate these both of these methods.  We first illustrate by length of the longest path of carbons.</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li>Chain length six: Since we've used all carbons then there are no more choices, and there is only one such isomer.</li>
<li>Chain length five: We need to add one more carbon.  We can't add it to either of the end carbons, because then we'd have a path of length 6.  We can add it to the central of the two chains, or alternatively to one either side of central -- the last two trees are isomorphic, giving us two possibilities</li>
<li>Chain length four: We need to add two more carbons.  Again, they can't be added to either of the end carbons, or we'd have a longer chain length.  Therefore, they most be added to the two central carbons.  One case is that we add one carbon to each of the two central carbons.  Alternatively, we could add both the carbons to the same "central" carbon reversing the order of the chain is a symmetry that interchanges the two central atoms.  We could add each carbon directly to the existing carbon in the chain, or we could add them one after the other making a chain of length two.  However, the resulting graph would have a chain of length 5 and already be counted.   Thus, there are two possibilities here.</li>
<li>Chain length three: We need at add three more carbons, and there's only one central carbon to attach them to.  We can't add them all directly to this central carbon, as that would create a carbon of degree 5.  On the other hand, once we add a chain of length longer than one to this central carbon we'd have a path of length 4 or greater.</li>
</ul>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Thus, we see there are five isomers of \(C_6H_{14}\text{.}\)  Alternatively, we could organize our search by deleting the hydrogens, and then considering the degrees of the resulting carbon-carbon graph.</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li>Degree at most two: If the resulting tree only had carbons of degree at most two, then it would have to be the path graph \(P_6\text{,}\) and so we only have one possibility here.</li>
<li>One vertex of degree three: If the resulting graph had exactly one carbon of degree three, that vertex and its three neighbours would account for 4 of our 6 carbons, and so we'd have to add two more.  We couldn't add them directly to the same vertex, as that would create a second vertex of degree three.  So, they could either be added as a chain of length two to one of the leaves of the existing graph, or they could be added to two separate leaves.  Drawing these graphs we see they're not isomorphic, and so we have two possibilities here.</li>
<li>Two vertices of degree three: If we have two vertices of degree three, one sees they'd have to be adjacent to each other, resulting in one possibity.</li>
<li>Vertex of degree four: A vertex of degree 4 and its four neighbours would account for all but one of the carbons.  We could add that carbon to any of the leaves, and get one more possiblity.</li>
</ul>
