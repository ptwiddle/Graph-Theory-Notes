</h6>Chain length four: We need to add two more carbons.  Again, they can't be added to either of the end carbons, or we'd have a longer chain length.  Therefore, they most be added to the two central carbons.  One case is that we add one carbon to each of the two central carbons.  Alternatively, we could add both the carbons to the same "central" carbon reversing the order of the chain is a symmetry that interchanges the two central atoms.  We could add each carbon directly to the existing carbon in the chain, or we could add them one after the other making a chain of length two.  However, the resulting graph would have a chain of length 5 and already be counted.   Thus, there are two possibilities here.</article><span class="incontext"><a href="s_intro_trees.html#li-30">in-context</a></span>
