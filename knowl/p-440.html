<p>The \(k\) colours are completely interchangeable, however; we could just change the names of each one.  Thus, it is clear that there are as many colourings of \(\bfG_2\) where \(v\) is red as there are where \(v\) is blue as there are where \(v\) is any given colour.  Hence, if we have \(k\) colours to use, exactly \(1/k\) of all colourings of \(\bfG_2\) will ahve \(v\) any given colour, namely \(P_{\bfG_2}(k)/k\)</p>
