<body><article class="hiddenproof"><p>A minor modification of our argument for Eulerian graphs shows that the condition is necessary.  Suppose that \(\Gamma\) is semi-Eulerian, with Eulerian path \(v_0, e_1, v_1,e_2,v_3,\dots,e_n,v_n\text{.}\)  Then at any vertex other than the starting or ending vertices, we can pair the entering and leaving edges up to get an even number of edges.</p>
<p>However, at the first vertex \(v_0\) the path cleaves along \(e_1\) the first time but never enters it accordingly, so that \(v_0\) has an odd degree; similarly, at \(v_n\) the path enters one final time along \(e_n\) without leaving, and so \(v_n\) also has an odd degree.</p>
<p>To see the condition is sufficient we could also modify the argument for the Eulerian case slightly, but it is slicker instead to <em class="emphasis">reduce</em> to the Eulerian case.  Suppose that \(\Gamma\) is connected, and that vertices \(v\) and \(w\) have odd degree and all other vertices of \(\Gamma\) have even degree.  Then we can construct a new graph \(\Gamma^\prime\) by adding an extra edge \(e=vw\) to \(\Gamma\text{.}\)  Then \(\Gamma^\prime\) is connected and every vertex has even degree, and so it has an Eulerian cycle.  Deleting the edge \(e\) that we added from this cycle gives an Eulerian path from \(v\) to \(w\) in \(\Gamma\text{.}\)</p></article></body>
