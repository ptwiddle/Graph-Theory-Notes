<p>Bob and Xing are considering this situation, and Bob suggests that a little modification to the algorithm should solve the problem. He says that if there are negative weights, they just have to find the smallest (i.e., most negative weight) and add the absolute value of that weight to every directed edge. For example, if \(w(x,y)\geq -10\) for every directed edge \((x,y)\text{,}\) Bob is suggesting that they add \(10\) to every edge weight. Xing is skeptical, and for good reason. Give an example to show why Bob's modification won't work.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="s_graphalgorithms_exercises.html#li-52">in-context</a></span>
