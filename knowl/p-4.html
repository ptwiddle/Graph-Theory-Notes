<p>We will typically use the letters \(G, H\text{,}\) or \(\Gamma\) (capital Gamma) to denote a graph.  The “dots” or the graph are called <!--Style me with CSS--><em>vertices</em> or <!--Style me with CSS--><em>nodes</em>, and the lines between the dots are called <!--Style me with CSS--><em>edges</em>. Graphs occur frequently in the “real world”, and typically how to show how something is connected, with the vertices representing the things and the edges showing connections.  </p>

<!--Style me with CSS--><em>Transit networks:</em> The London tube map is a graph, with the vertices representing the stations, and an edge between two stations if the tube goes directly between them.  More generally, rail maps in general are graphs, with vertices stations and edges representing line, and road maps as well, with vertices being cities, and edges being roads.</li>
<li>
<!--Style me with CSS--><em>Social networks:</em> The typical example would be Facebook, with the vertices being people, and edge between two people if they are friends on Facebook.</li>
<li>
<!--Style me with CSS--><em>Molecules in Chemistry:</em> In organic chemistry, molecules are made up of different atoms, and are often represented as a graph, with the atoms being vertices, and edges representing covalent bonds between the vertices.</li>
