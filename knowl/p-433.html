<p>It becomes more difficult when we try to colour vertex 3.  It is adjacent to vertices 2 and 4, and so cannot be the same colour as either of these.  However, vertices 2 and 4 are not adjacent, and so we don't know whether they have the same colour or not.  If vertices 2 and 4, have the same colour there are \(k-1\) possibilities for vertex 3, while if vertices 2 and 4 have different colours, there are only \(k-2\) possibilties.  Thus, we must count how many possibilities are in each of these cases.</p>
