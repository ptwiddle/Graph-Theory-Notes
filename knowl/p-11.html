<p>Another consequence of the definition is that edges are symmetric, and work equally well in both directions.  This is not always the case: in road systems, there are often one-way streets.  If we were to model Twitter or Instragram as a graph, rather than the symmetric notion of friends we would have to work with “following”.  To capture these, we have the notion of a <em class="emphasis">directed graph</em>, where rather than just lines, we think of the edges as arrows, pointing from one vertex (the source) to another vertex (the target).  To model Twitter or Instagram, we would have an ege from vertex \(a\) to vertex \(b\) if \(a\) followed \(b\text{.}\)</p>
