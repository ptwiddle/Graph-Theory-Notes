<p>If we want vertices 2 and 4 to have different colours, then we can first colour \(v_1\) any of \(k\) colours, colour \(v_2\) any of \(k-1\) colours.  Now, when we go to colour vertex 4 it can't be the same colour as vertex 1 since they are adjacent, and it can't be the same colour as vertex 2 by our supposition.  Vertices \(v_1\) and \(v_2\) have different colours, and so this leaves \(k-2\) possibilities for \(v_4\text{.}\)  Thus there are \(k(k-1)(k-2)\) possibilities to colour vertices 1, 2 and 4 so that 2 and 4 have different colours, and then there are \(k-2\) possibilities left for vertex 3, giving \(k(k-1)(k-2)^2\) ways to colour \(C_4\) so that vertices 2 and 4 have different colours.</p>
