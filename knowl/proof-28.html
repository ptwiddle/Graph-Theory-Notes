<article class="hiddenproof"><h6 class="heading"><span class="type">Proof</span></h6>
<p>The proof is extremely similar to that of the previous proposition.  A colouring of \(\bfG\) gives us colourings of \(\bfG_1\) and \(\bfG_2\text{,}\) but not any two colourings: they need to match at both \(v\) and at \(u\text{.}\)</p>
<p>Now, \(v\) could be any of the \(k\) colours, but \(u\text{,}\) being adjacent to \(v\text{,}\) can't be the same colour, and so it has \(k-1\) possibilities given a choose of colour for \(v\text{.}\)  Thus, there are \(k(k-1)\) ways to colour \(v\) and \(u\text{,}\) and all possibilities will occur equally often within the colourings counted by \(P_{\bfG_2}(k)\text{.}\)  Hence, given a colouring of \(\bfG_1\text{,}\) there will be \(P_{\bfG_2}(k)/[k(k-1)]\) ways to extendthat colouring to one of all of \(G\text{,}\) giving us the result.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="s_chromatic_polynomial_intro.html#proof-28">in-context</a></span>
