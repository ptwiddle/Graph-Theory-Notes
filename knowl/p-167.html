<p>Just as with graphs, it is useful to assign weights to the directed edges of a digraph. Specifically, in this section we consider a pair \((\bfG,w)\) where \(\GVE\) is a digraph and \(w\colon E\rightarrow\nonnegints\) is a function assigning to each directed edge \((x,y)\) a non-negative weight \(w(x,y)\text{.}\) However, in this section, we interpret weight as <dfn class="terminology">distance</dfn> so that \(w(x,y)\) is now called the <dfn class="terminology">length</dfn> of the edge \((x,y)\text{.}\) If \(P=(r=u_0,u_1,\dots,u_t=x)\) is a directed path from \(r\) to \(x\text{,}\) then the <dfn class="terminology">length</dfn> of the path \(P\) is just the sum of the lengths of the edges in the path, \(\sum_{i=0}^{t-1} w(u_iu_{i+1})\text{.}\) The <dfn class="terminology">distance</dfn> from \(r\) to \(x\) is then defined to be the minimum length of a directed path from \(r\) to \(x\text{.}\) Our goal in this section is to solve the following natural problem, which has many applications:</p>
