<p>Suppose there are three houses, owned by Alice, Bob, and Carol, and they'd each like to be connected to one of three Utilities, say, gas, electricity, and water.  There is no real difficulty in the real world, but if we add the restriction that we don't want any of the lines to cross over or under each other, the problem becomes quite interesting.  A failed attempt at drawing a solution is shown here.</p>
