<p>This formal definition has some perhaps unintended consequences about what a graph is.  Because we have identified edges with the two things they connect, and have a set of edges, we can't have more than one edge between any two vertices.  In many real world examples, this is not the case: for example, on the London Tube, the Circle, District and Picadilly lines all connect Gloucester Road with South Kensington, and so there should be multiple edges between those two vertices on the graph.</p>
