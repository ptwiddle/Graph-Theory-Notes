<body><article class="hiddenproof"><p>The proof is extremely similar to that of the previous proposition.  A colouring of \(\bfG\) gives us colourings of \(\bfG_1\) and \(\bfG_2\text{,}\) but not any two colourings: they need to match at both \(v\) and at \(u\text{.}\)</p>
<p>Now, \(v\) could be any of the \(k\) colours, but \(u\text{,}\) being adjacent to \(v\text{,}\) can't be the same colour, and so it has \(k-1\) possibilities given a choose of colour for \(v\text{.}\)  Thus, there are \(k(k-1)\) ways to colour \(v\) and \(u\text{,}\) and all possibilities will occur equally often within the colourings counted by \(\chi_{\bfG_2}(k)\text{.}\)  Hence, given a colouring of \(\bfG_1\text{,}\) there will be \(\chi_{\bfG_2}(k)/[k(k-1)]\) ways to extendthat colouring to one of all of \(G\text{,}\) giving us the result.</p></article></body>
