<body><article class="hiddenproof"><p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Let \(\bfT=(V,S)\) be any spanning tree of minimum weight among all spanning trees that contain the forest \(\bfF\text{,}\) and suppose that \(e=xy\) is not an edge in \(\bfT\text{.}\) (If it were an edge in \(\bfT\text{,}\) we would be done.) Then let \(P=(x_0,x_1,x_2,\dots,x_t)\) be the unique path in \(\bfT\) with (a) \(x=x_0\text{;}\) (b) \(y=x_t\text{;}\) and (c) \(x_ix_{i+1}\in S\) for each \(i=0,1,2,\dots,t-1\text{.}\) Without loss of generality, we may assume that \(x=x_0\) is a vertex in \(C\) while \(y=x_t\) does not belong to \(C\text{.}\) Then there is a least non-negative integer \(i\) for which \(x_i\) is in \(C\) and \(x_{i+1}\) is not in \(C\text{.}\) It follows that \(x_j\) is in \(C\) for all \(j\) with \(0\le j\le i\text{.}\)</p>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Let \(f=x_ix_{i+1}\text{.}\) The edge \(e\) has minimum weight among all edges with one endpoint in \(C\) and the other not in \(C\text{,}\) so \(w(e)\le w(f)\text{.}\) Now let \(\bfT_i\) be the tree obtained by exchanging the edge \(f\) for edge \(e\text{.}\) It follows that \(w(\bfT_i) = w(\bfT) - w(f) +w(e)\le w(\bfT)\text{.}\) Furthermore, \(\bfT_i\) contains the spanning forest \(\bfF\) as well as the edge \(e\text{.}\) It is therefore the minimum weight spanning tree we seek.</p></article></body>
