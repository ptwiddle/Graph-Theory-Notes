<body><article class="hiddenproof"><p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Of course, a case-by-case analysis of possibile Hamiltonian cycles is possible.  The number of cases can be reduced by using symmetries of the Petersen graph. Instead, for variation and to illustrate a different proof technique, we will use another method.</p>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Assume for contradiction that the Petersen graph is Hamiltonian, and draw the ten vertices \(v_1,v_2,\dots,v_{10}\) around the cycle.  The Hamiltonian cycle uses 10 of the 15 edges in the Petersen graph, and so there must be 5 more edges, with each vertex incident to one of them, as in the Petersen graph every vertex has degree 3.</p>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Let's analyse where else the edge adjacent to \(v_1\) could go.  It can't go to \(v_1\) itself, as the Petersen graph has no loops, and it can't go to \(v_2\) or \(v_{10}\) as the Petersen graph has no multiple edges.  If it went to \(v_3\) or \(v_9\) it would make a three cycle, which the Petersen graph doesn't have, and if it went to \(v_4\) or \(v_7\text{,}\) there'd be a four cycle.  Hence, the only options are \(v_1\) is adjacent to \(v_5, v_6\) or \(v_7\text{.}\)  By reversing the direction of the Hamiltonian path, \(v_5\) and \(v_7\) are equivalent, and there are only two cases.</p>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">But the same analysis holds for every vertex: the extra edge at any vertex can either go to the opposite side of the circle, or be "off by one" and skip three vertices to either direction.</p>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">We now claim that not all the extra edges can go "directly across" -- there must be at least one edge that's off by one.  If all the extra edges went directly across, then \(v_1\) would go to \(v_6\text{,}\) and \(v_2\) would go to \(v_7\text{,}\) and \(v_1-v_6-v_7-v_2-v_1\) would be a 4 cycle.</p>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Hence, without loss of generality we may assume that the extra edge at \(v_1\) is \(v_1-v_5\text{.}\)  Let us then consider the extra edge at \(v_6\text{.}\)  It can't go directly across, as that is \(v_1\) which already has its extra edge.  Hence it must be off by one, and go to either \(v_2\) or \(v_{10}\text{.}\)  But either way we get a four cycle: either \(v_1-v_2-v_6-v_5-v_1\text{,}\) or \(v_1-v_{10}-v_6-v_5-v_1\text{.}\)  Hence, we have a contradiction, and the Petersen graph cannot be Hamiltonian.</p></article></body>
