<p>Assume that \(u\) and \(w\) are two vertices coloured red that are adjacent.  Since \(u\) is red, the distance from \(v\) to \(u\) is odd -- there is a path \(v=v_0 - v_1 - \cdots - v_{2k+1}=u\text{.}\)  Similarly, there is an odd length path from \(v\) to \(w\text{:}\) \(v=w_0 - w_1 - \cdots - w_{2\ell+1}=w\text{.}\)  Taking the union of these two subgraphs and the edge connecting \(u\) and \(w\text{,}\) we get a closed walk consisting of \((2k+1)+(2\ell+1)+1=2k+2\ell+3\) edges, which is odd.  This walk may repeat some vertices and edges, but if it does we can split it into two smaller walks, one of which must have odd length, and eventually we must get a closed walk of odd length that doesn't repeat any vertices.</p>
