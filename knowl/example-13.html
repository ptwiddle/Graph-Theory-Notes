<div class="sidebyside"><div class="sbsrow" style="margin-left:1.25%;margin-right:1.25%;">
<div class="sbspanel" style="width:80%;justify-content:flex-start;"><p>Let's see what Prim's algorithm does on the weighted graph in <a knowl="./knowl/fig_graphalgorithms_spantreegraph.html" knowl-id="xref-fig_graphalgorithms_spantreegraph" alt="Figure 3.1.1 " title="Figure 3.1.1 ">FigureÂ 3.1.1</a>. We start with vertex \(a\) as the root vertex. The lightest edge connecting \(a\) (the only vertex in the tree so far) to the rest of the graph is \(ag\text{.}\) Next, \(fg\) is added. This is followed by \(fi\text{,}\) \(fj\text{,}\) \(bj\text{,}\) and \(bc\text{.}\) Next, the algorithm identifies \(ck\) as the lightest edge connecting \(\{a,g,i,f,j,b,c\}\) to the remaining vertices. Notice that this is considerably later than Kruskal's algorithm finds the same edge. The algorithm then determines that \(al\) and \(jd\text{,}\) both of weight \(56\) are the lightest edges connecting vertices in the tree to the other vertices. It picks arbitrarily, so let's say it takes \(al\text{.}\) It next finds \(dl\text{,}\) then \(ek\text{,}\) and then \(em\text{.}\) The final edge added is \(ch\text{.}\) The full list of edges added (in order) is shown to the right. The total weight of this spanning tree is \(504\text{.}\) This (not surprisingly) the same weight we obtained using Kruskal's algorithm. However, notice that the spanning tree found is different, as this one contains \(al\) instead of \(dj\text{.}\) This is not an issue, of course, since in both cases an arbitrary choice between two edges of equal weight was made.</p></div>
