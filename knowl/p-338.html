<p>The drawing of \(K_6\) using another trick that is worth explaining.  It begins with the drawing of \(K_5\) in black, and adds new stuff in red.  It appears that four new vertices have been added, one at each corner of the square.  But actually, when the edges are identified, the four corners of the sphere get identified into one point on the torus.  (Check this by visualizing what happens if you folded the paper up!).  Placing one of the vertices on this graph on the corner can be useful because then edges drawn from this vertex will not need to wrap around the sides of the square.</p>
