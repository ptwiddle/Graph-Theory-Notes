<p>Now, we need to choose one more vertex to be a red vertex, and the vertices we haven't used are 3, 10, and 8.  If we tried to make 3 the last red vertex we run into a problem: we need to connect vertex 3 to 3 other vertices, but one of the edges goes to vertex 4 which was one of the subdivided vertices that we can't visit again.  Hence, we only have two possible paths out of 3, and will ever only be able to connect it to two blue vertices.  A similar problem occurs if we try to make 10 the last red vertex -- it's adjacent to the vertex 7 used as a subdivided vertex.  The remaining choice is vertex 8, which works, as shown in the following diagram.</p>
