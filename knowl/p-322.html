<p>People used to think that the earth was flat, because if you can't see the whole thing, but can just look at just one little patch of it around you, it looks like a piece of \(\reals^2\text{.}\)  Formally, a mathematicians say "locally homeomorphic to \(\reals^2\)" to mean that you can't tell it apart from \(\reals^2\) by just looking at a small piece of it.</p>
