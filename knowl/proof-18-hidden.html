<body><article class="hiddenproof"><p>As in the proof of colourings of disjoint unions, a colouring of \(\bfG\) gives a colouring of both \(\bfG_1\) and \(\bfG_2\) by restriction, but we don't get any two colourings: both \(\bfG_1\) and \(\bfG_2\) contain \(v\text{,}\) and our two colourings must both make \(v\) the same colouring.</p>
<p>In the other direction, if we have colourings of \(\bfG_1\) and \(\bfG_2\) that have the same colour at \(v\text{,}\) it is clear that we can glue them together to get a colouring of \(\bfG\text{.}\)  So the question reduces to the following: given that we want vertex \(v\) to have a fixed colour, how many colourings of \(\bfG_2\) are there that colour \(v\) this colour?</p>
<p>The \(k\) colours are completely interchangeable, however; we could just change the names of each one.  Thus, it is clear that there are as many colourings of \(\bfG_2\) where \(v\) is red as there are where \(v\) is blue as there are where \(v\) is any given colour.  Hence, if we have \(k\) colours to use, exactly \(1/k\) of all colourings of \(\bfG_2\) will ahve \(v\) any given colour, namely \(\chi_{\bfG_2}(k)/k\)</p>
<p>Thus, to colour \(\bfG\) with \(k\) colours, we first could first colour \(\bfG_1\) in one of the \(\chi_{\bfG_1}(k)\) ways.  This will give us a some fixed colour of \(v\text{,}\) and we saw above that there are \(\chi_{\bfG_2}(k)/k\) colourings of \(\bfG_2\) where \(v\) has this colour, and so we have the result.</p></article></body>
