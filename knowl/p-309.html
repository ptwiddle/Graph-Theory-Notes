<p>The solution will be to think about drawing the graphs on the sphere \(S^2\) instead of the plane.  First, let's see why this solves our problem.  On the plane, the inside of a circle is different from the outside of a circle -- the inside is bounded, but the outside is unbounded.  However, on the sphere, the two sides of a circle are equivalent -- you can deform any circle to be an equator, and then the northern hemisphere is equivalent to the southern hemisphere. This shows on there sphere, the inside and the outside aren't really different cases.</p>
