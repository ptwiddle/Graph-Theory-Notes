<body><article class="hiddenproof"><p>It is immediate from the definitions that 3 implies 2 which implies 1, as any path is a trail, and any trail is a walk.</p>
<p>That 1 implies 3 is intuitively obvious: if you repeat a vertex, then you've visited someplace twice, and weren't taking the shortest route.  Let's make this argument mathematically precise.</p>
<p>Suppose we have a walk \(v=v_0,e_1,\dots, e_m, v_m=w\) that is not a path.  Then, we must repeat some vertex, say \(v_i=v_k\text{,}\) with \(i\lt k\text{.}\)  Then we can cut out all the vertices and edges between \(v_i\) and \(v_k\) to obtain a new walk</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
v=v_0,e_1, v_1,\dots, e_i, v_i=v_k, e_{k+1}, v_{k+1}, e_{k+2}, v_{k+2}, \dots, v_m
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>Since \(i \lt k \text{,}\) the new walk is strictly shorter than our original walk.  Since the length of a walk is finite, if we iterate this process the result must eventually terminate.  That means all our vertices are distinct, and hence is a path.</p></article></body>
