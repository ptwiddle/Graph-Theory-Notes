<body><article class="hiddenproof"><p>The theorem holds trivially when \(x=r\text{.}\) So we consider the case where \(x\neq r\text{.}\) We argue that \(\delta(x)\) is the distance from \(r\) to \(x\) and that \(P(x)\) is a shortest path from \(r\) to \(x\) by induction on the minimum number \(k\) of edges in a shortest path from \(r\) to \(x\text{.}\) When \(k=1\text{,}\) the edge \((r,x)\) is a shortest path from \(r\) to \(x\text{.}\) Since \(v_1=r\text{,}\) we will set \(\delta(x)=w(r,x)\) and \(P(x)=(r,x)\) at Step 1.</p>
<p>Now fix a positive integer \(k\text{.}\) Assume that if the minimum number of edges in a shortest path from \(r\) to \(x\) is at most \(k\text{,}\) then \(\delta(x)\) is the distance from \(r\) to \(x\) and \(P(x)\) is a shortest path from \(r\) to \(x\text{.}\) Let \(x\) be a vertex for which the minimum number of edges in a shortest path from \(r\) to \(x\) is \(k+1\text{.}\) Fix a shortest path \(P=(u_0,u_1,u_2,\dots,u_{k+1})\) from \(r=u_0\) to \(x=u_{k+1}\text{.}\) Then \(Q=(u_0,u_1,\dots,u_k)\) is a shortest path from \(r\) to \(u_k\text{.}\) (See <a knowl="./knowl/fig_graphalgorithms_dijkstra-proof.html" knowl-id="xref-fig_graphalgorithms_dijkstra-proof" alt="Figure 3.3.7 " title="Figure 3.3.7 ">Figure 3.3.7</a>.)</p>
<figure class="figure-like"><img src="images/image-32.svg" width="75%" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;" alt=""><figcaption><span class="type">Figure</span><span class="codenumber">3.3.7</span>Shortest paths</figcaption></figure><p>By the inductive hypothesis, \(\delta(u_k)\) is the distance from \(r\) to \(u_k\text{,}\) and \(P(u_k)\) is a shortest path from \(r\) to \(u_k\text{.}\) Note that \(P(u_k)\) need not be the same as path \(Q\text{,}\) as we suggest in <a knowl="./knowl/fig_graphalgorithms_dijkstra-proof.html" knowl-id="xref-fig_graphalgorithms_dijkstra-proof" alt="Figure 3.3.7 " title="Figure 3.3.7 ">Figure 3.3.7</a>. However, if distinct, the two paths will have the same length, namely \(\delta(u_k)\text{.}\)  Also, the distance from \(r\) to \(x\) is \(\delta(u_k)+w(u_k,x)\ge \delta(u_k)\) since \(P\) is a shortest path from \(r\) to \(x\) and \(w(u_k,x)\geq 0\text{.}\)</p>
<p>Let \(i\) and \(j\) be the unique integers for which \(u_k=v_i\) and \(x=v_j\text{.}\) If \(j \lt i\text{,}\) then</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
\delta(x)= \delta(v_j)\le \delta(v_i)= \delta(u_k)\le
\delta(u_k)+w(u_k).
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>Therefore the algorithm has found a path \(P(x)\) from \(r\) to \(x\) having length \(\delta(x)\) which is at most the distance from \(r\) to \(x\text{.}\) Clearly, this implies that \(\delta(x)\) is the distance from \(r\) to \(x\) and that \(P(x)\) is a shortest path.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if \(j&gt;i\text{,}\) then the inductive step at Step \(i\) results in</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
\delta(x)\le \delta(v_i)+w(v_i,y)=\delta(u_k)+w(u_k,x).
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>As before, this implies that \(\delta(x)\) is the distance from \(r\) to \(x\) and that \(P(x)\) is a shortest path.</p></article></body>
