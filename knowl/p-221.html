<p><a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/figure-hamiltonian-obstruction.html" title="Figure 2.3.4">FigureÂ 2.3.4</a> shows a portion of a larger graph \(\bfG\text{.}\)  The exact number of other vertices in the graph that \(X\) and \(Y\) are adjacent to is not important; what matters is that \(A\) and \(B\) are each adjacent to two vertices, \(X\) and \(Y\text{.}\)  Any path through \(A\) would have to use \(X\) and \(Y\text{,}\) but so would any path through \(B\text{.}\)  But then we have a small four cycle \(XAYBX\) which doesn't use any other vertices in the graph, and so \(\bfG\) cannot be HAmiltonian.</p>
