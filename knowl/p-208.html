<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">All that remains is to justify that \(\bfG\) contains at least one closed walk, given that every vertex has even degree and it contains at least one edge.  We form a walk \(w\) by starting at any vertex \(v\) and at each step choosing any edge we've never traversed before at random as the next step of the walk.  We claim that \(w\) must eventually return back to the starting vertex \(v\text{.}\)  Since \(\bfG\) is finite, and we don't repeat edges, the only way we could fail to return to \(v\) would be if our walk "got stuck" -- that is, at some point we reach a vertex \(u\) and find that every edge out of \(u\) has already been traversed.  However, we know that \(u\) has an even number of edges, and also arguing as in the first paragraph of the proof that every time the walk \(w\) visits \(u\) it must use up two edges, one for arrival and one for departure.  Hence, when we arrive at \(u\) at any time we must have used up an odd number of edges at \(u\) -- an even number from all the previous times we have visited \(u\text{,}\) plus one more that we just arrived from.  Since \(u\) has even degree, there must always be at least one edge available for us to choose from, and so we can never "get stuck" and will eventually reach \(w\) again.</p>
