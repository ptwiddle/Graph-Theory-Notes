<p>We sketch a few of the main ideas of the proof in an informal setting now, before giving a complete formal proof.  To learn this proof for the exam, you should have this informal picture in your head, and perhaps a skeleton outline of the main formal points that need to be shown.  You shouldn't try to memorize the formal proof word for word like a poem; instead, practice expanding out from the informal ideas/skeleton proof to the full formal proof on your own a few times.</p>
