<p>The idea of the earth being the surface of the torus probably seems absolutely ridiculous, but it happens "by accident" in videogames.  In old games like Pacman or Asteroids, the game takes place on one computer screen, but to keep it from having edges and corners the designers made the game "wrap around" -- if anything goes off the right edge of the screen, it comes back at the corresponding spot on the left edge of the screen, and similarly anything that goes off the top of the screen comes back on the bottom of the screen.</p>
