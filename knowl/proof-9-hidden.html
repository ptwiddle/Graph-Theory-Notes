<body><article class="hiddenproof"><p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">We first show that if \(\bfG\) is Eulerian, then every vertex \(v\in\bfG\) has even degree.  For suppose the Eulerian cycle visits the vertex \(v k\) times.  Each time it visits \(v\) it must arrive by one edge, and leave by a different edge. Since the walk is Eulerian, every edge adjacent to \(v\) will be used exactly once by the walk, and so we see that \(d(v)=2k\) as desired.</p>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Now we suppose that \(\bfG\) is connected and that every vertex has even degree.  We will induct on the number of edges of \(\bfG\text{.}\)  If it has no edges, then the theorem is vacuously true -- we can just take the empty walk.</p>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">For the inductive step, suppose that \(\bfG\) is connected with \(m\) edges, and that every vertex of \(\bfG\) has even degree.  Further assume, for the inductive hypothesis, that every graph \(\bfH\) with these properties and <em class="emphasis">less</em> than \(m\) edges is Eulerian.</p>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Suppose for now that we can find <em class="emphasis">a</em> closed walk \(w\) in \(\bfG\) that doesn't repeat any edges -- we will justify that this at the end of the proof.  If the closed walk \(w\) uses all the edges of \(\bfG\text{,}\) then \(w\) is an Eulerian cycle, and we are done.</p>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">If \(w\) doesn't use all the edges of \(\bfG\text{,}\) we can delete all the edges used in \(w\) and get a graph \(\bfG\setminus w\) with fewer than \(m\) edges.  Though \(\bfG\setminus w\) might not be connected, every vertex in \(\bfG\setminus w\) will have even degree, as we've subtracted an even number of edges from each vertex that \(w\) visits as argued in the first part of the proof.  Thus, by the inductive hypothesis each connected component \(\bfG\setminus w\) will have an Eulerian cycle.  Since the \(\bfG\) is connected, \(w\) must include at least one point from each component of \(\bfG\setminus w\text{,}\) and so we can insert the Eulerian walk on the edges of each component of \(\bfG\setminus w\) from each component into \(w\) when we reach that component, to obtain a closed walk \(w^\prime\) that uses all the edges of \(\bfG\) exactly once, as desired.</p>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">All that remains is to justify that \(\bfG\) contains at least one closed walk, given that every vertex has even degree and it contains at least one edge.  We form a walk \(w\) by starting at any vertex \(v\) and at each step choosing any edge we've never traversed before at random as the next step of the walk.  We claim that \(w\) must eventually return back to the starting vertex \(v\text{.}\)  Since \(\bfG\) is finite, and we don't repeat edges, the only way we could fail to return to \(v\) would be if our walk "got stuck" -- that is, at some point we reach a vertex \(u\) and find that every edge out of \(u\) has already been traversed.  However, we know that \(u\) has an even number of edges, and also arguing as in the first paragraph of the proof that every time the walk \(w\) visits \(u\) it must use up two edges, one for arrival and one for departure.  Hence, when we arrive at \(u\) at any time we must have used up an odd number of edges at \(u\) -- an even number from all the previous times we have visited \(u\text{,}\) plus one more that we just arrived from.  Since \(u\) has even degree, there must always be at least one edge available for us to choose from, and so we can never "get stuck" and will eventually reach \(w\) again.</p></article></body>
