<body><article class="hiddenproof"><p>First let's name the vertices of \(K_{3,3}\text{:}\) let the vertices \(a,b,c\) be the red and vertices and \(x,y,z\) be the blue vertices.  Then the path \(a-x-b-y-c-z-a\) is a Hamiltonian cycle, and so if \(K_{3,3}\) were planar it would be drawn as a circle in the plane, as shown below:</p>

The added edge could go around the right of the circle, as shown below here:</p>

<p>If we had began by drawing \(a-y\) outside the circle, then we would have had to draw \(c-x\) inside the circle, and had the same problem with being able to draw the last line; as shown here:</p>
