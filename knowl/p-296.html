<p>The graph \(\bfG_2\) looks just like \(K_{3,3}\text{,}\) but we have added an extra vertex of degree two in the middle of one of the edges.  Note that \(K_{3,3}\) is <em class="emphasis">not</em> a subgraph of \(\bfG_2\text{,}\) and so we need to use slightly different reasoning than we did for showing \(\bfG\) isn't planar.  But drawing \(\bfG_2\) is just like drawing \(K_{3,3}\) and then adding an extra dot for the new vertex of degree two.  If we could draw \(\bfG_2\) in the plane, we could just skip adding this extra dot, and we'd have a drawing of \(K_{3,3}\) in the plane.  Again, since we know \(K_{3,3}\) isn't planar, we see that \(\bfG_2\) isn't planar, either.</p>
