<p>To actually represent graphs drawn on the Möbius strip, we work similarly to what we did for the torus; we draw a square, and then we draw arrows on the left and right edges to indicate that these edges are drawn together.  However, we have one arrow drawn up, and one arrow drawn down, to indicate that the ends of the strip are glued together with a half twist.   Since the top and bottom of the Möbius strip do not get identified together at all, we do not draw any arrows on them.  Then, if an edge goes off one end the Möbius strip near the top, it comes back on the opposite end near the bottom, and vice versa.</p>
