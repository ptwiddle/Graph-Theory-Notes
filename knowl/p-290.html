<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">For the first fact, it suffices to note that if there were more than one distinct path from \(x\) to \(y\) in \(\bfT\text{,}\) we would be able to find a cycle in \(\bfT\text{.}\) This is impossible since it is a tree. For the second, we refer to <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig_graphalgorithms_exchange.html" title="Figure 3.2.5">FigureÂ 3.2.5</a>. The black and green edges in the graph shown at the left represent the spanning tree \(\bfT\text{.}\) Thus, \(f\) lies on the unique path from \(x\) to \(y\) in \(\bfT\) and \(e=xy\) is an edge of \(\bfG\) <em class="emphasis">not</em> in \(\bfT\text{.}\) Adding \(e\) to \(\bfT\) creates a graph with a unique cycle, since \(\bfT\) had a unique path from \(x\) to \(y\text{.}\) Removing \(f\) (which could be any edge \(f_i\) of the path, as stated in the proposition) destroys this cycle. Thus \(\bfT_i\) is a connected acyclic subgraph of \(\bfG\) with \(n-1+1-1=n-1\) edges, so it is a spanning tree.</p>
