<p>Consider the graph \(\bfG\) consisting of two triangles joined at the right a vertex, shown at the right.  We can calulate \(P_\bfG(k)\) by working vertex by vertex: there are \(k\) ways to colour vertex 1, but then when we colour vertex 2 it can't be the same as vertex 1, and so there are \(k-1\) ways to colour it.  Vertex three is adjacent to both one and two, so there are \(k-2\) ways to colour it, and vertex 4 is adjacent to one coloured vertex, vertex 3, so there are again \(k-1\) ways to colour it, and finally vertex 5 is adjacent to vertices 3 and 4 and so we have \(k-2\) ways to colour it.</p>
