<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">To construct a closed walk, we'd like to show we eventually have to return to \(v_0\text{.}\)  We're only working with finite graphs, so our walk can't continue forever; the only possibility we have to rule out is that we reach some vertex \(v_n\) and find that we have already used every vertex incident to \(v_n\text{.}\)  But as we saw before, the path will pair up the edges incident to each vertex as an arriving edge and a departing edge, and we know the degree of \(v_n\) is even.  If the path has already visited \(v_n k\) times, then we'll have used \(2k\) of the edges incident to it; when we arrive for the \(k+1\)st time we'll use one edge, and in all we'll have used \(2k+1\) edges, an odd number; since the degree of \(v_n\) is even there must be at least one edge we haven't used to exit by.</p>
