<p>To show a graph is a tree, it suffices to show that it is connected and that the number of edges is one less than the number of vertices.  Since Alkanes are molecules, we know that the graph is connected.  Furthermore, \(C_nH_{2n+2}\) has \(n\) carbons adn \(2n+2\) hydrogens, and hence has \(3n+2\) vertices.  Thus, it is enough to show that any molecule with formula \(C_nH_{2n+2}\) has \(3n+1\) edges.</p>
