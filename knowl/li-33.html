</h6>One vertex of degree three: If the resulting graph had exactly one carbon of degree three, that vertex and its three neighbours would account for 4 of our 6 carbons, and so we'd have to add two more.  We couldn't add them directly to the same vertex, as that would create a second vertex of degree three.  So, they could either be added as a chain of length two to one of the leaves of the existing graph, or they could be added to two separate leaves.  Drawing these graphs we see they're not isomorphic, and so we have two possibilities here.</article><span class="incontext"><a href="s_intro_trees.html#li-33">in-context</a></span>
